# Tile encoding + UCB algorithm

Here I implememted an algorithm that finds the optimal action of Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) using tile encoding of "arms" for faster convergence
and Upper Confidence Bound for action selection. More information about tile encoding and UCB you can find in the Sutton and Barto's book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction".  

The algorithm was created for subsequent application in implementation of [Generalised Distribution Iteration algorithm (GDI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06232) algorithm as a distribution iterator.
