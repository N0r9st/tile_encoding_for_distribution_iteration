# Tile encoding + UCB algorithm

Here I implememted algorithm that finds optimal action of Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) using tile encoding for faster convergence
and Upper Confidence Bound fo action selection based on Richard S. Sutton's and Andrew G. Barto's book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction".  

The algorithm was used for subsequent application in [Genealised Distribution Iteration algorithm (GDI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06232) as
distribution iterator.
